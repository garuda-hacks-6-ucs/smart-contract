# BlocTenderID : Beaches aren't gonna clean themselves. ðŸš€

BlocTenderID is a Blockchain and AI-powered digital tender platform designed to create a transparent, fair, and nepotism-free government procurement process. It empowers citizens to participate in selecting the most suitable vendors through decentralized public voting, while smart contracts automate secure and timely payments.

## ðŸ§© Architecture

### ðŸ“œ Smart Contract

    ```
    â”œâ”€â”€ smart-contract/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ lib/              # External dependencies or libraries (via forge install)
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/          # Deployment and automation scripts using Forge
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src/              # Main smart contract source files
    â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ lib/          # Contains reusable code like custom errors and event declarations
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ test/             # Smart contract test files (e.g., unit tests)
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ .env              # Environment variables (e.g., RPC URL, private key)
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore        # Git ignore rules
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ .gitmodules       # Tracks git submodules (e.g., external contracts/libs)
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Makefile          # Automation commands for building, testing, and deploying
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ foundry.toml      # Foundry configuration file (e.g., compiler version, optimizer)
    ```
